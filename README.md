# Stock Analysis (2017-2018)


### Challenge
Current version of the green stocks file calculates the total volume accumuated over the year and the percentage change over the entire year, on a ticker by ticker basis. I chose to include a section of code that will identify new tickers automatically instead of hardcoding ticker names. This version is limited to files where the stocks are organized by ticker and then chronologically within those groups.
